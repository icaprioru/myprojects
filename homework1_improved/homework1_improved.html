        <h3>Rules for Autocomplete</h3>
        <h6>Posted on March 19, 2019</h6>
        <section class="rules__article__section">
            <p>Autocompleting text with known values seems like an
                easy problem to solve, but so so so many Uls get it wrong.
                I see this frequently enough that, rather than complain
                about them individually, I though I'd just write down
                the set of rules they often break.</p>
            <p>There may be cases where some of these rules aren't the
                best thing to do, but there should be a good reason for
                breaking one of these rules (for example, some of these
                rules don't apply if a field must be filled with a value
                from a fixed set, like the list of US states). Following
                these rules should always result in at very least a
                sane experience:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Exact matches always come first.
                    If the user types in an option exactly,
                    other options must always go
                    below the one matching what they typed.</li>
                <li>Besides exact matches, prefix matches come first.
                    If I type "Fr" I want " Fresno" not "San Francisco."</li>
                <li> After prefix matches, it can fall back to substring
                    matches. Starting with substring matches would almost
                    always be the wrong thing to do since users start
                    typing words at the beginning not somewhere in the
                    middle.</li>
                <li> If there are no substring matches, it can optionally
                    fall back to subsequence matching. This is only useful in
                    some cases.</li>
                <li> If there are no subsequence/substring matches,
                    it can optionally fall back to approximate matches.
                    This is
                    rarely necessary to provide.</li>
                <li> Matches should be sorted alphabetically.</li>
                <li> When one option is the prefix of another, put
                    the shortest one first.</li>
                <li> The matching should probably be case insensitive unless
                    there are two options that differ only by case. In
                    that case (pun intended), prefer the one that more closely
                    matches the user's input.</li>
                <li> The action to make use of the selection (e.g. to search
                    the term) must be a different key than the action to
                    accept the first suggestion unless you have to do something
                    first to start using autocomplete suggestions (e.g.
                    hit the down arrow). The user should never have to take
                    extra steps to not use autocomplete.
                </li>
